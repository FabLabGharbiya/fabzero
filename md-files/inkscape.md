- If i want to work on an project that includes cutting a sticker on vinyl cutter i have to know the actual dimensions that i want to cut
- Create a new document with these dimension
- If the resolution is low so the output product will be bad
- If i increase the resolution that will make it better
- We begin to import the wanted image, it is better to be a high resolution so the difference in color appears
- Tracing bitmap : `path.trace bitmap`
- Export image as png
- Options : `page,600 dsi`
- vinyl needs about 600, pcb needs about 1000 to 1200
