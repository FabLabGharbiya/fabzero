# Ultimaker

- visual ultimaker troubleshooting
- what caused the problem and how to solve it
- calibrating ultimaker
- filament 2.85 and nozzle 0.4 and 0.6 and 0.8 and temp 190 there will be a speed will be determined
- if the filament is going out slow but moving the head slowly it will produce too many filament
- the thickness of the filament will change other parameters
- when i have to print any thing i have to design depending on what i have
- the studnts have to know what is there and then work
- leveling is the most important problem
same level and the same distance
- the distance may be far from the plate so problems occuer
- leveling, filament, no dust
- we can print filament dust filter and put cotton to clean the filament
- also clean the dust on the plate
- method for cleaning the nozzle : cleaning the nozzle from bottom by inserting any thing
- maybe the nozzly is not fully blocked so filament will climb into it
- or using the atmoic method
- the rods shouldn't be move by moving it
- i have to untighten the screww and bring the rod back and retighten again
