 to do list can be made inside my repository, in project tab i create new project and choose from template basic kanban
 i can made labels for each note
 if i have a problem i should depug it
 if iam doning something and problem happend, i should move it to problem column
 top down depugging : like change the bit if it breaks
 down top depugging : i have to know the reason
 there are copies of your work though tha changes you make
 there are exacly the same copy locally on your pc in a hiddent folder called .git
 each add. you make a copy of the modified files locally
 each commit you make a copy of the locally file to the series of changes but locally
 each push i upload the series online
 it's better to commit for each point or solution or step
 comminting for the whole day is not useful 
 git reset head returns the file from git . step
 files which add . will be commited
 but files didn't add . will not be commited
 `du fabzero` used to list all the files
 `du -s fabzero` used to tell the size of the folder
 `du -sh fabzero` used to tell the size by human way

shopbot :
working steps
1. safety distance
2. power on the electricity
3. release the two emergency buttons
4. power on the machine and hear the fan sound
5. connect the usb and control button
6. press on the reset button and hear small noise
7. open the app
notes:
- i have to see the machine while moving the access
- the button is designed so that each direction move the machine in the same as i see it
- move the direction to check that it is working
- x and y directions have limit switches but not z so i have to be careful when moving it
how to set the x and y and z orginis
1. after working steps make sure that z is at approperiate distance above the plate by making the z is 0
2. when set the x and y automatically the z is set automatically at 25 high, so i have to be carefull of this feature
3. after the machine is set to x and y zero
4. to set z i use the metal plate
5. i connecto the crocodile with the metal part that is used to connect it
6. test the connectivity by making the bit and metal plate touch
7. not put the metal plate under the bit and press on z set button until it touches the metal plate, if the bit is far i press on the emergency button fast
8. after finishing i press the two emergency buttons and shutdown the power of the machine and put the emergency button on the shopbot and remove the usb and shutdown the pc
laser cutter
- i have to make periodic maintainence by cleaning the lences and internal plate and the compressor filter
- don't print on any metal you don't know
- you can use fabmodulas but you will print raster and vector sepratly
