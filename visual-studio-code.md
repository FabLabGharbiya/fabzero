- I can use it to edit files
- It uses markdown language, it is like html but easier and easy to understand and read
- emoji can be used but after installing it's feature from the square on the lower left
- It is better to leave one line between each line, there is another feature used to help in this method named markdownlint
- To send commit manually from the user (update is the file name)
```
sh update hi how are you
    - git pull
    - git add -all
    - git commit -m "$*"
    - git push
```

- or ``` code block ``` to make a a block of code
